agents:
  utilitarian:
    model: claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
    system_prompt_path: apps/parliament-mcp/src/agents/prompts/utilitarian.txt # We will reference inline or path
    # For simplicity in this demo, we might inline prompts or point to a file we need to generate.
    # But since we have them in registry.ts, Archestra needs to know how to load them.
    # Ideally, Archestra calls the MCP server to get the prompt, or we duplicate it here?
    # Let's assume we define them here for Archestra to spin them up.
